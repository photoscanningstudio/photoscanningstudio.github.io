<p>The Scan is Just the Beginning: Your Ultimate Guide to Archiving Digitized Photos</p>
<p>You've conquered the scanning – awesome! Your precious family photos are now digital files. But to ensure they truly last, remain accessible, and serve future generations, you need to move beyond just having files to creating a robust digital archive.</p>
<p>Think of scanning as gathering the valuable materials; archiving is building the secure, organized vault to keep them safe and usable forever. This guide provides the ultimate checklist for creating that vault for your Western New York memories.</p>
<p>1. Foundation: High-Quality Scans
Your archive is only as good as its foundation.</p>
<p>Resolution: Prints scanned at 600 DPI (our standard) provide detail for viewing, printing, and future use. Negatives/slides need higher resolution.</p>
<p>Enhancements: Starting with enhanced scans (like those included in our service) means better-looking files from the get-go, reducing later editing needs.</p>
<p>File Formats:</p>
<p>JPEG (.jpg): Universally compatible, smaller files. Use highest quality setting. Excellent for access copies.</p>
<p>TIFF (.tif): Lossless, best for archival master copies of essential photos. Preserves all data but creates large files. Consider keeping both TIFF masters and JPEG access copies.</p>
<p>2. Structure: Logical Organization
Chaos is the enemy of archiving.</p>
<p>Folder Hierarchy: Use a clear, consistent system. Chronological (Decade -> Year -> Event) is highly recommended for easy browsing and understanding by others.</p>
<p>Meaningful File Names: Start with date (YYYY-MM-DD), add context (names, event, place). 2001-06-15_Jones_Wedding_Botanical_Gardens_Buffalo_055.jpg is infinitely better than IMG_6034.jpg.</p>
<p>3. Context: Metadata is Crucial
Embed the story within the files!</p>
<p>Tags/Keywords: Add names (full names!), locations (be specific!), events, themes. Use consistent terms. This makes your archive searchable.</p>
<p>Descriptions/Captions: Identify people, explain the event, add anecdotes. This is your voice speaking to the future. Utilize the metadata fields in your OS or photo software.</p>
<p>4. Safety Net: The 3-2-1 Backup Rule (Mandatory!)
The cornerstone of digital safety.</p>
<p>3 Copies: Your working copy + 2 backups.</p>
<p>2 Different Media: e.g., Computer SSD + External HDD + Cloud Storage. Protects against media-specific failures.</p>
<p>1 Offsite Copy: Essential for disaster protection (fire, flood, theft). Use a cloud backup service (highly recommended for automation), cloud storage sync, or a physically separate hard drive updated regularly.</p>
<p>5. Long-Term Care: Maintenance & Migration
Archives need occasional tending.</p>
<p>Regular Backups: Automate them if possible.</p>
<p>Integrity Checks: Periodically verify that backup files are readable.</p>
<p>Media Refresh: Replace external hard drives every 3-5 years. Optical media (CD/DVD) is not recommended for archiving.</p>
<p>Format Migration (Future): Decades from now, you (or descendants) might need to migrate files to newer standard formats if current ones become obsolete (though JPEG/TIFF are very stable).</p>
<p>6. Documentation: Leave a Map
Create a "Read Me" text file in the archive's root folder explaining your organization system, naming conventions, key family names, and how to access metadata.</p>
