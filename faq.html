      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-intro">
        <p>Quick answers about scanning photos, albums, pickup, and mail-in options with Photo Scanning Studio in Hamburg, NY.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 1. Turnaround -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does scanning take?</h3>
        <p>Most projects are finished in <strong>5–10 business days</strong> once your photos arrive at our Hamburg studio. Mail-in orders add shipping time, so plan on about <strong>2 weeks total</strong>. Bigger projects may take longer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer rush service?</h3>
        <p><strong>Sometimes.</strong> Rush jobs depend on our schedule and the size of your project and usually include an extra fee. If you have a firm date (memorial, slideshow, reunion, etc.), tell us when you <a href="index.html#contact">request a quote</a> and we’ll let you know what’s realistic.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2. What we scan -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What types of media do you scan?</h3>
        <p>We scan:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loose photo prints</li>
          <li>Polaroids</li>
          <li>Photos up to <strong>8.5″ × 11″</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Basic color correction and enhancement are included. <strong>We do not scan slides or film negatives in-house.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you scan slides or negatives?</h3>
        <p>Right now we focus on <strong>photo prints only</strong>, so slides and film negatives aren’t part of our in-house service.</p>
        <p>If you have 35mm slides or negatives, we recommend using a dedicated <strong>slide &amp; negative scanner</strong> at home, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/493umeB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this slide and negative film scanner on Amazon</a> (affiliate link). You can digitize your film while we handle your photo prints.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 3. Delivery & USB -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How will I receive my digitized images?</h3>
        <p>You can choose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Secure cloud delivery (free)</strong> – a private download link to share with family</li>
          <li><strong>USB drive</strong> – you may <strong>bring your own USB</strong>, or we can provide one for a flat <strong>$20 per USB</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mail-in orders always include a private download link, even if you also choose USB.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 4. Pickup / drop-off -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where do you offer pickup and drop-off?</h3>
        <p>We operate from a <strong>home studio in Hamburg, NY</strong>, so all visits are <strong>by appointment only</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hamburg:</strong> Pickup and drop-off are <strong>free</strong> by appointment.</li>
          <li><strong>Within ~40 miles of Hamburg:</strong> Pickup is usually <strong>$10</strong>. Optional drop-off after scanning is another <strong>$10</strong> if you’d like us to return everything in person.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tell us your town when you <a href="index.html#contact">request a quote</a> and we’ll confirm availability.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 5. Prep & albums -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How should I prepare my photos?</h3>
        <p>For the best price and fastest turnaround, please:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Send <strong>loose photos only</strong> (no tape, glue, or sticky residue)</li>
          <li>Remove photos from plastic sleeves and “magnetic” album pages if possible</li>
          <li>Group photos into bundles (for example, by year or event) with simple labels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our high-speed scanner cannot safely run <strong>stuck-together or taped photos</strong>, so those require slower, manual handling.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What about albums or sticky photos?</h3>
        <p>You’re welcome to bring albums, but there is extra labor to remove or hand-scan each image.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simpler albums:</strong> Photos slide out easily – lower additional fee.</li>
          <li><strong>Old sticky/magnetic albums:</strong> Photos are often glued down and must be scanned one at a time on a flatbed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Album handling typically runs about <strong>$20–$50 per album</strong>, in addition to the normal per-photo scanning fee. We’ll look at your albums and give you a clear estimate before we start.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you accept fragile or damaged prints?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We can usually scan curled, fragile, or lightly damaged prints with extra care. Very delicate items may need flatbed scanning and will be priced individually if they require significant manual work.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 6. AI / extras -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer AI enhancement or colorization?</h3>
        <p>Yes. In addition to standard scanning, we can often:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enhance soft, dark, or faded photos</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Colorize black-and-white images</strong></li>
          <li>Create short, tasteful <strong>photo-to-video animations</strong> for tribute videos or keepsakes (case-by-case)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These AI projects are quoted individually once we see your images and understand what you’re hoping to do.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 7. Pricing & payments -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
        <p>For standard photo scanning, our typical minimum is around <strong>$50</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you only have one or two special photos that need restoration or colorization, <a href="index.html#contact">send us a note</a> and we’ll suggest the simplest option.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
        <p>We currently accept:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cash</li>
          <li>Major credit and debit cards</li>

          <li>Venmo</li>
          <li>Zelle</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- 8. Mail / VHS / sharing -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you work with customers outside Buffalo and Western New York?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Many customers ship their photos to us. We’ll walk you through safe packing, let you know when your box arrives, and return everything with tracking once scanning is finished.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you convert VHS tapes or home movies?</h3>
        <p>No, we focus on photo scanning. On our <a href="DIY.html#vhs-options">DIY Tools &amp; VHS Options</a> page, we list recommended services and DIY devices so you can still digitize your tapes while we handle your photos.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can my family share the digitized photos?</h3>
