      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-intro">
        <p>Here are answers to the most common questions we get about scanning photos, albums, and family collections at Photo Scanning Studio in Hamburg, NY.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Core service questions -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does scanning take?</h3>
        <p>Most orders are completed in <strong>5–10 business days</strong> at our Hamburg home studio. Mail-in projects add shipping time—plan on about <strong>2 weeks total</strong>. Larger projects may take a bit longer. If you have a deadline coming up (memorial, slideshow, reunion, etc.), just let us know when you <a href="index.html#contact">request a quote</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer rush service?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, yes. <strong>Rush service is available on a case-by-case basis</strong> depending on our current schedule and the size of your project. There is usually an additional fee.</p>
        <p>If timing is critical, mention your date in the contact form and we’ll tell you what is realistic before you commit.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What types of media do you scan?</h3>
        <p>We specialize in <strong>loose photo prints, Polaroids, and large-format photos up to 8.5″ × 11″</strong>. Every scan includes basic color correction and enhancement at no extra charge. <strong>We do not currently scan slides or film negatives in-house.</strong></p>
        <p>If you’re not sure whether something is scannable, just <a href="index.html#contact">send us a quick photo</a> and we’ll let you know.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you scan slides or negatives?</h3>
        <p>Right now we focus on <strong>photo prints only</strong>, so we don’t scan slides or film negatives in-house.</p>
        <p>If you have 35mm slides or negatives you’d like to digitize, we recommend a dedicated <strong>slide &amp; negative scanner</strong> you can use at home, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/493umeB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this slide and negative film scanner on Amazon</a> (affiliate link). It lets you convert your film to digital while we handle your photo prints.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you return my original photos?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Your originals always come back to you. After scanning, we carefully repack your photos and albums for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local pickup or drop-off</strong> in Hamburg (by appointment only)</li>
          <li><strong>Tracked return shipping</strong> for mail-in orders</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What resolution do you scan at?</h3>
        <p>We scan everything at <strong>600 DPI</strong> for high-resolution, archival-quality files. You’ll receive both:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Original scans</strong> (true to the source)</li>
          <li><strong>Lightly enhanced versions</strong> (color and contrast tuned to look their best on modern screens)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How will I receive my digitized images?</h3>
        <p>Most customers choose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Secure cloud delivery (free)</strong> – a private download link you can share with family</li>
          <li><strong>USB drive add-on</strong> – a labeled USB for an extra layer of backup</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mail-in orders always include a private download link, even if you also select a USB.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Local & logistics -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where do you offer pickup and drop-off?</h3>
        <p>We operate from a <strong>home studio in Hamburg, NY</strong>, so all visits are <strong>by appointment only</strong> for security and privacy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hamburg:</strong> Free curbside-style drop-off and pickup by appointment.</li>
          <li><strong>Nearby areas:</strong> We can often offer free or low-cost pickup in <strong>Orchard Park, West Seneca, Angola, Derby, Eden, and North Boston</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Beyond that:</strong> Pickup and delivery usually start around <strong>$20+</strong>, depending on distance and schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just mention your town when you <a href="index.html#contact">request a quote</a> and we’ll confirm options and pricing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you work with customers outside Buffalo and Western New York?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Many customers mail their photos to us. We’ll walk you through safe packing, keep you updated when your box arrives, and return everything with tracking once your order is complete.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my order safe in the mail?</h3>
        <p>We know these aren’t just “pictures”—they’re irreplaceable family memories. For mail-in orders we recommend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using a <strong>sturdy box</strong> (not a thin envelope)</li>
          <li>Packing photos tightly between cardboard so they don’t slide around</li>
          <li>Adding <strong>tracking and insurance</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use similar care when returning everything to you. If you’re nervous about shipping, contact us and we’ll help you plan the safest option.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- What we do / don't do -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you accept photo albums or fragile prints?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. We routinely scan:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Older <strong>magnetic “sticky” albums</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Vintage scrapbooks</strong> and mixed-size pages</li>
          <li><strong>Curled, fragile, or slightly damaged</strong> prints</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When possible, we gently remove photos to get the best-quality scan and then return them to the album. Extremely fragile or glued-down items are handled case-by-case.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you convert VHS tapes or home movies?</h3>
        <p>We currently focus on <strong>photo scanning only</strong> and don’t convert VHS, Hi8, MiniDV, or film reels in-house.</p>
        <p>However, we know many families have boxes of tapes right next to their photos. On our <a href="DIY.html#vhs-options">DIY Tools &amp; VHS Options</a> page we list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trusted mail-in conversion services</li>
          <li>DIY capture devices and gear (via Amazon affiliate links)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This way, you can still get your <strong>videos digitized</strong> while we take care of the photos.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I scan photos myself to save money?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Some customers prefer a do-it-yourself approach, especially for smaller batches. On our <a href="DIY.html">DIY Tools page</a> we share:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scanners we personally like for home use</li>
          <li>Photo storage boxes and organizers</li>
          <li>Supplies that make sorting and labeling easier</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those recommendations may include Amazon affiliate links, which help support the studio at no extra cost to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How should I store my photos after they are scanned?</h3>
        <p>Digitizing is step one—long-term storage is step two. We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moving prints into <strong>acid-free, archival boxes</strong> or albums</li>
          <li>Keeping them in a cool, dry area away from attics and basements</li>
          <li>Backing up your digital files in at least <strong>two places</strong> (USB, external drive, and/or cloud)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You’ll find our favorite storage boxes and organizers on the <a href="DIY.html#storage">DIY Tools &amp; Storage</a> section of the site.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Quality, AI & restoration -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer restoration or AI enhancement for damaged images?</h3>
        <p><strong>Basic enhancement</strong>—color correction, exposure tweaks, and gentle sharpening—is included free on all orders.</p>
        <p>For more serious issues (heavy fading, stains, rips, missing pieces), we can often use a mix of traditional editing and <strong>AI-based tools</strong> to clean up and improve the image. Every restoration job is different, so we’ll review a few samples and give you an honest opinion and quote before you decide.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>⭐ New: Do you offer AI colorization or custom photo-to-video projects?</h3>
        <p>Yes, in select cases. Using modern AI tools, we can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Colorize black-and-white photos</strong> to give them a more lifelike look</li>
          <li><strong>Enhance and “fix” certain problem images</strong> that are soft, dark, or mildly damaged</li>
          <li>Explore <strong>short, tasteful animations</strong> that bring a still photo to life (for example, subtle movement suitable for a tribute video or keepsake)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because every image and project is unique, these are quoted individually once we see your source photo(s) and understand your goals.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Pricing & practicalities -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a minimum order size?</h3>
        <p>For standard photo scanning, our typical minimum is around <strong>$50</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you have a very small project—like a single important photo that needs restoration, colorization, or a special AI treatment—just <a href="index.html#contact">reach out</a> with the details. We’ll let you know what options make the most sense.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
        <p>We try to make payment easy. We currently accept:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cash</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Major credit and debit cards</strong></li>
          <li><strong>PayPal</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Venmo</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Zelle</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you <a href="index.html#contact">request a quote</a>, we’ll confirm the best option for your order.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can my family share the digitized photos?</h3>
        <p>Yes! That’s one of the biggest benefits of digitizing. Your download link can be shared with siblings and relatives, and additional USB drives can be ordered if you’d like physical copies for multiple households.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="faq-outro">
        Still have a question we didn’t cover? <a href="index.html#contact">Contact us here</a>—we’re happy to help plan the best way to preserve your family’s photos.
